### The reason of this repo
The reason why I decided to make this repository was because I aim to show my learning path in C# by creating amazing projects.
### Why C#?
#### I decided to use it for several reasons which can help me in my current role as a data scientist. 
#### Some of them are:
- I can create games with it
- It can be used in Data Science projects (LinQ)
- Backend
- Web Apps
- etc
